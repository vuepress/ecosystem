3. Click CONNECT on the Clusters page, follow the steps to allow connections from all IP addresses ([Why?](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-to-allowlist-deployment-ip-address)), create Database user, and record the database connection string, please change the `<password>` in the connection string to the database password

6. Go to Settings - Environment Variables, add the environment variable `MONGODB_URI`, the value is the database connection string in step 3
