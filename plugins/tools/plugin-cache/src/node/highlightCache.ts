/**
 * Code highlight is a relatively time-consuming operation,
 * especially in `shiki` where enabling numerous transformers can significantly impact performance.
 * This effect is particularly noticeable with tools like `twoslash`,
 * which require type compilation and may lead to individual code blocks taking over 500ms to process.
 *
 * When there are multiple code blocks, focusing only on modifying parts of the code blocks while
 * still compiling all code blocks entirely can lead to unnecessary overhead.
 * Therefore, using the LRU cache algorithm can help by storing unchanged code blocks'
 * highlighted results and only processing the parts that have been modified.
