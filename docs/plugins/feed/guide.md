## Usage

The `vuepress-plugin-feed2` plugin can generate feed files in the following three formats for you:

- Atom 1.0
- JSON 1.1
- RSS 2.0

::: important Please use RSS if possible. Atom and JSON are only provided for best compatibility.

:::

Please set `atom`, `json` or `rss` to `true` in the plugin options according to the format you want to generate.

::: tip You can enable them all. This is not a "1 of 3" choice.

:::

Considering that rare people stick to feed now, this plugin provides a minimal configuration to adjust the automatic generation of detailed feed files. Also, it allows you to freely define the output content of the feed.

To correctly generate the link address, you need to set `hostname` (deployment domain name) in the plugin options,

## Preview

When you open the feed file in browser, we magically convert atom and rss feed xml to human readable html via xsl template. Check [atom](/atom.xml) and [rss](/rss.xml) feed of this site as an example!

If you want to preview your feed in devServer, set `devServer: true` in plugin options. You may also need to set `devHostname` if you are not using the default `http://localhost:{port}`.

## Channel settings

You can customize the feed channel information by setting the `channel` option.

We recommend the following settings:

- Convert the date of creating the feed to ISOString and write it into `channel.pubDate`
- The update period of the content set in `channel.ttl` (unit: minutes)
- Set copyright information via `channel.copyright`
- Set the channel author via `channel.author`.

::: tip Default channel settings

- By default, the title and description of the channel is the name and description of the site.
- The link of the channel and the last update time will be automatically generated by the plugin.

For detailed options and their default values, see [Configuration → Channel Settings](./config/channel.md)

You can control how feed item is generated in specific article by configuring the `feed` option in frontmatter.

### Customize Feed Generation

You can take full control of feed items generation by configuring the `getter` in the plugin options.

### I18n Config

The plugin generates separate feeds for each language.

You can provide different settings for different languages via `locales` in the plugin options.
